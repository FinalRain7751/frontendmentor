## My process

- First, I chalked out the layout and what to use (Grid, Flexbox) to get it done correctly.
- Then I set up all the custom properties (P.S. I love working with custom properties.)
- Then the CSS was not that difficult.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Reinforced my learnings of CSS.

### Continued development

I need improvement in the areas of accessibikity, handling images and videos and most importantly working with a pre-processor.

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell - Do check out his courses on CSS.
- MDN.
